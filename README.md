Heroku-hosted web app uses Spotify API to scrape most popular songs from a party of Spotify users to create mutually liked, common Playlist (Python, Flask, Spotify API, Heroku, JS, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap).

This web app was created as our submission for Capital One's intern hackathon (Carbon). Optimal Playlist uses Spotify's API to scrape the most popular songs from a party of Spotify users to create a mutually liked, common playlist. This is an effort to eliminate situations in whihc someone is "on aux" or playing music that the rest of the crowd/party may not like as well.

Since this app has been deployed with Heroku, just navigate to the following website: https://optimalplaylist.herokuapp.com/

When prompted for Spotify URI's for each user, make sure you enter each person's 10-digit unique identifier which can be found on each person's profile. These URI's must be distinct (you cannot use the same person's URI 2 or all 3 times in a single execution of the application).

I worked on this project with Shivam Patel, Yash Bora, and Ayushi Sharma.
