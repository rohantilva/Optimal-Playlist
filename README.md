# Optimal-Playlist
Heroku-hosted web app uses Spotify API to scrape most popular songs from a party of Spotify users to create mutually liked, common Playlist (Python, Flask, Spotify API, Heroku, JS, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap).


This web app was created as our submission for Capitl One's intern hackathon (Carbon). Optimal Playlist uses Spotify's API to scrape the most popular songs from a party of Spotify users to create a mutually liked, common playlist. This is an effort to eliminate situations in whihc someone is "on aux" or playing music that the rest of the crowd/party may not like as well. 

Since this app has been deployed with Heroku, just navigate to the following website: https://optimalplaylist.herokuapp.com/

I worked on this project with Shivam Patel, Yash Bora, and Ayushi Sharma.
